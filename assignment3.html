        <h2>Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>

        <h3>Q1: Which genres generate the highest total global sales?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis1a"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>
              The bar chart displays the total global sales sorted by genre, 
              highlighting which game genres generate the highest sales worldwide.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Q2: How are global sales distributed across genres across major platform ecosystems (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and PC)?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis1b"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>
              The stacked bar chart shows total global sales by genre, broken down by platform ecosystem (Sony/PlayStation, Microsoft/Xbox, Nintendo, and PC). It highlights how different ecosystems contribute to genre performance and how genre strength varies across ecosystems.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Insight</h3>
        <p>
          Overall sales are concentrated in a few high-selling genres. The ecosystem breakdown shows that genres do not perform the same across the market. Instead, Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and PC each have a different mix of genre sales, suggesting that ecosystem audiences and identities shape which genres sell best.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Choices</h3>
        <p>
          A bar chart was selected for Q1 because it clearly compares categorical totals and makes ranking genres straightforward. For Q2, a stacked bar chart was chosen to show both overall sales and ecosystem composition within each genre. Grouping platforms into major ecosystems (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, PC) simplifies comparison and avoids overwhelming the viewer with too many individual platforms.

        <h2>Visualization 2: Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h2>

        <h3>Q1: How have global sales changed over time across major manufacturers (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and PC)?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis2a"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>The line chart shows how total global video game sales change over time when platforms are grouped by manufacturer (Sony/PlayStation, Microsoft/Xbox, Nintendo, and PC). Each line represents a manufacturer group, making it easier to compare market growth, peak years, and declines across major ecosystems.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Q2: How have global sales changed over time for the top genres?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis2b"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>The line chart illustrates how global sales have evolved over time for the top five genres. By comparing trends across years, the chart highlights shifts in player interest and shows which genres grew, remained stable, or declined over different periods.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Insight</h3>
        <p>
          The time series suggests that sales rise and fall in waves rather than staying stable over time. When grouped by manufacturer, peaks and declines align with major hardware eras and shifts in the market. Comparing manufacturers and genres side by side helps highlight periods of overall market expansion or contraction, and shows when specific ecosystems or genres diverge from broader trends.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Choices</h3>
        <p>
          Line charts were used because they effectively communicate change over time. Grouping platforms by manufacturer reduces visual clutter and makes long-term trends easier to interpret. Limiting Q2 to the top genres ensures the chart remains readable while still highlighting meaningful shifts in market interest.

        <h2>Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>

        <h3>Q1: How do total sales for the top platforms compare across NA, EU, JP, and Other regions?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis3a"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>
              The grouped bar chart compares total sales for the top eight platforms across North America (NA), Europe (EU), Japan (JP), and Other regions.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Q2: For each top platform, which regions contribute most to its overall sales?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis3b"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>
              This stacked bar chart shows the regional sales composition for the top eight platforms.
              Each platform’s total sales are split into North America (NA), Europe (EU), Japan (JP), and Other segments, highlighting regional preferences and revealing whether a platform’s success is concentrated in one region or balanced globally.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Insight</h3>
        <p>
          The regional comparisons reveal that platform success is geographically uneven.
          Some platforms appear to rely heavily on a single dominant market, while others show a more balanced distribution across regions.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Choices</h3>
        <p>
          A grouped bar chart was used in Q1 to allow direct comparison of regional totals for each platform. The stacked bar chart in Q2 emphasizes proportional composition, making it easier to see which regions dominate a platform’s overall sales. Using consistent regional color encoding improves readability across both charts.

        <h2>Visualization 4: Nintendo vs. Other Platforms Over Time</h2>

        <h3>Q1: How have global video game sales changed over time for Nintendo platforms compared to all other platforms?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis4a"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>
              This line chart compares total global sales over time between Nintendo platforms (NES, SNES, N64, GB, GBA, DS, Wii, WiiU) and all other platforms combined.
              It highlights when Nintendo was most dominant and how its overall sales trajectory compares to the rest of the industry across different eras.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Q2: How does Nintendo’s share of total global sales shift over time compared to the rest of the market?</h3>
        <div class="viz-layout">
          <div id="vis4b"></div>

          <div class="viz-text">
            <p>
              This stacked area chart shows the market-wide total sales over time, split into Nintendo vs. Other platforms. 
              The visualization reveals periods when Nintendo contributed a larger portion of total sales and periods when other platforms dominated.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h3>Insight</h3>
        <p>
          The comparison suggests that Nintendo’s performance is characterized by distinct cycles of dominance associated with major hardware generations.
          Periods of increased Nintendo share align with platform-era peaks, while subsequent declines indicate intensified competition and market transition toward other ecosystems.
          Overall, the pattern emphasizes that platform leadership is dynamic and shaped by product cycles, innovation, and broader industry shifts.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Choices</h3>
        <p>
          A line chart was selected for Q1 to compare long-term sales trajectories between Nintendo and the broader market. The stacked area chart in Q2 highlights relative market share over time rather than absolute totals. This combination allows both magnitude and proportion to be examined, reinforcing the cyclical nature of platform dominance.
