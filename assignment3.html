        <h3>Insight</h3>
        <p>
          The time series patterns indicate that platform and genre popularity changes in waves rather than remaining stable across the full timeline.
          Peaks and declines likely reflect platform life cycles, technological shifts, and changing consumer preferences.
          Comparing multiple lines makes it possible to identify periods of market expansion or contraction, as well as moments when specific platforms or genres outperform broader trends.
